## Key Features

- üöÄ **High Performance:** Built with Rust and Tokio for asynchronous, concurrent scanning.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Multiple Enumeration Modes:** Supports `RCPT TO`, `VRFY`, `EXPN`, and experimental `Timing`, `Combined`, and `Stealth` methods (`-m`). `Auto` mode intelligently selects the best method.
- üîê **TLS Support:** Handles Plaintext, STARTTLS (port 25/587), and Implicit TLS (port 465) connections (`-s`). Optional certificate verification skip (`--tls-skip-verify`).
- ‚ö° **Concurrency Control:** Adjustable number of concurrent connections (`-c`) and connection pool size (`--pool-size`).
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Timing Adjustments:** Configurable timeouts (`-t`), retries (`-r`), fixed delays (`--delay`), and experimental adaptive delays (`--adaptive-delay`).
- üé® **Flexible Output:**
  - Standard colorized console output (default).
  - JSON (`-f json`) for machine parsing.
  - CSV (`-f csv`) for spreadsheets.
  - Simple `Machine` format (`-f machine`).
  - Live mode (`-L`) for real-time results (disables progress bar).
  - Verbose mode (`-v`) for detailed connection/debugging info.
- üéØ **Target Flexibility:** Handles single usernames, wordlists (`-u`), optional domain appending (`-d`), and target randomization (`--randomize`).
- üïµÔ∏è **Server Fingerprinting:** Optional attempt to identify SMTP server software (`--fingerprint`).
- üö¶ **Graceful Shutdown:** Responds to `Ctrl+C` to stop cleanly.

## Probing Mechanisms (-m)

SMTPeek employs several methods to determine if a username/email corresponds to a valid account. Servers respond differently and may disable certain commands, so choosing the right mode (or using Auto) is crucial.

- **Auto** (Default)
  - How: Intelligently selects the best available method based on the server's capabilities advertised in the `EHLO` response.
  - Order: Prefers `VRFY` > `EXPN` > `RCPT TO`.
  - Best For: General use when server capabilities are unknown.
- **Rcpt**
  - How: Uses the standard SMTP transaction flow: `MAIL FROM:<sender>` followed by `RCPT TO:<target_email>`. Resets (`RSET`) between checks on the same connection.
  - Interpretation: Relies on the server's response code to `RCPT TO`.
    - 250 / 251: Valid.
    - 550 / 551 / 553 / common rejection messages: Invalid.
    - 4xx (Temporary Errors): Unknown (may indicate rate limiting).
  - Notes: Most widely supported method.
- **Vrfy**
  - How: Uses the `VRFY <username_or_email>` command. Some servers check only the username part.
  - Interpretation:
    - 250 / 251: Valid.
    - 252 (Ambiguous): Treated as Valid (account likely exists).
    - 550 / 551 / 553: Invalid.
    - 50x (Command Errors): Unknown.
  - Notes: Often disabled or returns ambiguous responses for security.
- **Expn**
  - How: Uses the `EXPN <list_or_alias>` command. Primarily for mailing lists.
  - Interpretation:
    - 250: Valid.
    - 5xx: Invalid.
    - 50x (Command Errors): Unknown.
  - Notes: Very often disabled.
- **Timing** (Experimental)
  - How: Uses `RCPT TO` internally. Compares the response time for the target user against a baseline time for a known-invalid user.
  - Interpretation: If the target user's response time is significantly longer than the baseline (using internal heuristics), it's flagged as potentially Valid, even if the status code indicates invalid/unknown.
  - Notes: Highly sensitive to network conditions and server behavior. Prone to false positives/negatives. Use critically.
- **Combined** (Experimental)
  - How: Attempts `VRFY`, then `EXPN`, then `RCPT` sequentially.
  - Interpretation: Returns the result of the first method that yields a definitive Valid or Invalid status. If all are Unknown, the final status is Unknown.
  - Notes: Can be useful if unsure which command works, but less efficient. May trigger more alerts.
- **Stealth** (Experimental)
  - How: Attempts to mimic less aggressive behavior. Uses random delays, sends a partial VRFY (mostly ignored), uses a slightly randomized `MAIL FROM` for the `RCPT TO` check.
  - Interpretation: Relies primarily on the `RCPT TO` result.
  - Notes: Effectiveness varies greatly depending on server detection mechanisms.

## Examples

### Default Mode (Concurrent, Auto Method)

```bash
# Test users from list against example.com, use 5 connections
smtpeek -u users.txt -d example.com -c 5 example.com
```

Example output:

```bash
# [...] Banner and Config [...]

[>] Connection to example.com:25 - Establishing connection pool...
[>] Connection to example.com:25 - Validating initial pool connection...
[+] Connection to example.com:25 - Pool connection verified successfully

[!] Running with 5 concurrent connections. High concurrency on slow networks (e.g., VPN) or against rate-limited/slow servers may cause delays or appear unresponsive. Consider lowering concurrency (-c) if issues arise.

[+] validuser@example.com - VALID 250 2.1.5 Ok
  Processing... [=================>] 100/100 (0s) Processing completed

------------------------------------------------------------
STATS Total: 100 | Valid: 1 | Invalid: 99 | Unknown: 0
------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------
Valid User Details:

  validuser@example.com          - 250 2.1.5 Ok
------------------------------------------------------------
```

### Live Mode (Sequential for Small Lists)

```bash
# Test users, show results immediately (disables progress bar)
smtpeek -u users.txt -d example.com -L example.com
```

Example output:

```bash
# [...] Banner and Config [...]

[>] Connection to example.com:25 - Establishing connection pool...
[>] Connection to example.com:25 - Pool connection verified successfully

[INFO] Small list in live mode, forcing sequential processing (concurrency=1).

[FAIL] unknown@example.com 550 5.1.1 User unknown
[SUCC] validuser@example.com 250 2.1.5 Ok
# ... more results ...

# --- Results Summary --- (Only shown if live or verbose)
# [+] validuser@example.com        - VALID    250 2.1.5 Ok
# [+] unknown@example.com        - INVALID  550 5.1.1 User unknown
# --- End Summary ---

------------------------------------------------------------
STATS Total: 100 | Valid: 1 | Invalid: 99 | Unknown: 0
------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------
Valid User Details:

  validuser@example.com          - 250 2.1.5 Ok
------------------------------------------------------------
```

### Implicit TLS (Port 465) and JSON Output

```bash
# Test list via implicit TLS, save results to JSON (with disabled colors)
smtpeek -C -u users.txt -d example.com -s -p 465 -f json -o results.json secure.example.com
```

Example output:

```
[
  {
    "email": "valid@example.com",
    "raw_response": "250 2.1.5 Ok",
    "reason": "RCPT accepted",
    "response_time_ms": 150,
    "status": "Valid",
    "username": "valid"
  },
  {
    "email": "invalid@example.com",
    "raw_response": "550 5.1.1 User unknown",
    "reason": "RCPT rejected",
    "response_time_ms": 80,
    "status": "Invalid",
    "username": "invalid"
  }
]
```

## Improvements Over Legacy Implementations\*

- SMTPeek offers significant advantages compared to older, often script-based tools (like smtp-user-enum in Perl or Python):
- True Concurrency: Uses async Rust for massively parallel checks, far exceeding sequential script performance.
- Modern Networking: Robust handling of TCP, STARTTLS, Implicit TLS, and connection pooling.
- Advanced Techniques: Includes experimental timing and stealth modes beyond basic command checks.
- Compiled Performance: Native code execution eliminates interpreter overhead.
- Memory Efficiency: Rust's memory management avoids common pitfalls of script memory usage.
- Flexible Output: Built-in support for common formats like JSON and CSV.
